## Overview
**Updates** help you stay on top of all your activity on DevRev.  

Work items for which you are an `owner`, `creator`, have been `@mentioned` or `commented on` will automatically be shown in your updates. For other work items, you can `follow` them to receive some or all updates through the bell icon ðŸ”” on the work item. 

## Follow work

* You can `follow` work items to start receiving updates by checking all or some update types.
.
* You can `unfollow` work items to stop updates by unchecking all or some update types. 
.
* Both `Discussions` and `Field updates` will show up as `Participation` updates.
* `Participation` updates are the most frequent and we suggest `unfollowing` them to reduce noise in your updates.
