# PLuG Overview

Welcome to DevRev PLuG platform! Our goal is to provide an easy to use experience that empowers your end users and customer facing teams with ready access to relevant information to enable more effective communication. This document provides definitions of some key components of the platform.

**PLuG**

This refers to the part of the platform that directly enables communication with and understanding of your end users. This includes your customer success and support teams.

PLuG is not an exact acronym but can be interpreted as Product-Led User Growth.

**PLuG Widget**

This is the widget or ‘chat box’ that your end users will use to interact with you. You can find [installation instructions here](https://www.devrev.ai/docs/plug/widget-config).

**PLuG Inbox**

This is where conversations started by your end users are found. You can access it from the left hand navigation bar in the DevRev app.

**Conversation**

Conversations refer to the communication chain you have with your end user accessible through the PLuG inbox. This is different from a ticket.

**Ticket**

A ticket is used to capture anything that you may need to follow up on from a conversation. In general, this will be bugs, feature requests, and anything in between. Not all conversations will lead to tickets (for example, quick questions about if there is a sale can be handled within the conversation without a ticket created).

The ticket should describe what the end user is experiencing in language that is familiar to them. Developer specific language will be reflected in Issues.

**Parent Ticket**

Tickets can be linked as children of other tickets if you would like to organize them in this way.

**Issue**

An Issue describes what the developer will work on. Tickets and Issues should be linked and it is a many to many relationship. For example, it may require multiple issues to resolve a ticket or one Issue may resolve multiple tickets if end users experience and describe the same issue in different ways.
